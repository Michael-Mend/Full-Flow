# Full Flow
![Mobile UI]()

## Purpose 

One goal, and arguably the most ambitious one, of Full Flow is to curate a comprehensive list of every vehicle launched into space. There is currently one application with a similar purpose. Claude Lafleur's Spacecraft encyclopedia has cataloged every single launch since the inception of space flight. However, the data ends just shy of the end of 2017. I aim to fill in the gap in addtion to condensing the information by focusing of families of spacecraft as opposed to individual launches.

Another thing Full Flow hopes to accomplish is an up to date catalog of all upcoming rocket launches with links to livestreams or live viewing options.

## User Story

As a space enthusiast 

I want to be able to search for space craft based on parameters such as:
    - manufacturer
    - origin
    - launch sites
    - operational time period
    - involved missions

So I can fulfill my desire for knowledge about space craft

I also want to be able to find the next upcoming launches 

So I am able to make plans to watch them either live or via livestream
